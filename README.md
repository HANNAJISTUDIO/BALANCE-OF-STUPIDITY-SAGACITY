# **The FINE L_NE of ‘STUPID-TY & SAGAC+TY’**
HOW IS CREATIVE COMPUTING AFFECTING THE HUMAN BRAIN?
##### _*brain network connectivity*_
The establishment of the technology revolution is outrageously 
accelerating conducting impact and effects on the human brain network.
>It does not simply imply good vs. bad but tackles a case of 
stupidity or sagacity. 

In the current generation, where people have no choice whether they want 
technology or not, we constantly have to update to new communication 
technology, which leaves a question of, “who rules over technology?”. 
Technology has emerged into an intimidating yet friendly monster over 
time to the point where some feel baffled to catch up and anxious they 
would miss out.

Such a tenacious and compatible relationship derives into ‘technology 
dependence’ (infinity text) which raises a point of dispute; “is technology 
cultivating stupidity or sagacity?”

## Stupidity (-c0ns*)
Excessive technology dependence will gradually deteriorate brain 
functionality. Yuval Noah Harari, a historian, and an author _“...believes 
new technologies could hijack democracy and even humans’ sense of self"_ 
(ThePrint 2021). Technology has been embedded in everyday lives that humans 
need daily reminders of the _“most basic task of life”_(ThePrint 2021).
